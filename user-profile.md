# User profiles
{: #user-profile}

A user profile is an entity that is stored and maintained by {{site.data.keyword.appid_full}}. The profile contains a user's attributes and identity and can be anonymous or linked to an identity managed by an identity provider.
{:shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} provides an API for logging in, either anonymously or by authenticating with an OpenId Connect (OIDC) [identity providers](/docs/services/appid/identity-providers.html#setting-up-idp). The user profile attribute API endpoint is a resource that is protected by the access token that is generated by {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} during the login and authorization process.


## Storing, reading, and deleting user attributes

## Data separation and encryption
{: #data}

{{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} stores and encrypts user profile attributes. As a multi-tenant service, every tenant has a designated encryption key and user data in each tenant is encrypted with only that tenant's key.

{{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} ensures that private information is encrypted before it is stored.
