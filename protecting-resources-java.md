## Updating the Liberty for Java sample
{: #updating-liberty}

To make an update in the sample app, use the following instructions:

1. Create the servlets, jsp's, and html.
2. Define the protected resources and add them to the `web.xml` and `server.xml` authorization filters.
3. Create a war file and deploy it to Liberty for Java.

For more information about updating apps, see [adding {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} to an existing application](/docs/services/appid/existing.html#existing-liberty).
