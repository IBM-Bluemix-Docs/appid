# Securing back-end resources

You can use the {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} server SDKs to protect and access endpoints in your apps. You can also use the client SDKs to access protected resources.

**Note**: Calling a protected resource starts the login widget, if necessary. If a valid token was already obtained, the login widget is not started, and the resource is accessed directly.

## Protecting resources in Liberty for Java
{: #protecting-liberty}

You can use {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} to protect endpoints in your IBM Liberty for Java apps. Liberty for Java has the built in ability to handle Open ID Connect (OIDC) requests.

Before you begin:
* You need an existing, unbound, [IBM Liberty for Java app](https://console.bluemix.net/catalog/starters/liberty-for-java). To become familiar with developing Liberty for Java apps, see [the docs](/docs/runtimes/liberty/index.html).
* Be sure you have [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) installed.
* Learn about how OIDC works with Liberty for Java.

To protect your resources:

1. Download the Liberty for Java sample from the UI. The sample contains a zip file with the standard Liberty files.
2. Open terminal at the directory where you extracted the sample.
3. Log in to {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} by using the Cloud Foundry command line. When prompted, input your credentials.

  ```
  cf login
  ```
  {: codeblock}

4. Deploy the app. Running the following command creates a Liberty for Java instance with a name related to the tenantid.

  ```
  cf push
  ```
  {: codeblock}

5. Bind your service instance to the new Liberty for Java instance, and redeploy the app.
6. Open your app in a browser and login by using your credentials to review authentication activities.

## Protecting resources in Node.js
{: #protecting-resources-nodesdk}

The {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} server SDK provides an ApiStrategy passport strategy that is used in back-end apps that are deployed on {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}}. To protect your app from unauthorized access, you must instrument your Node.js server with the ApiStrategy. The `appid-serversdk-nodejs npm module` provides the ApiStrategy passport strategy and the verification method to validate the access token and ID token that are issued by {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}}.

The {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} server SDK uses the <a href="http://passportjs.org/" target="_blank">Passport framework <img src="../../icons/launch-glyph.svg" alt="External link icon"></a> to enforce authorization.

The following snippet demonstrates how to use `APIStrategy` in a simple Express app to protect the `/protected` endpoint GET methods.

  ```JavaScript

  var express = require('express');
  var passport = require('passport');
  var APIStrategy = require('bluemix-appid').APIStrategy;

  passport.use(new APIStrategy());
  var app = express();
  app.use(passport.initialize());

  app.get('/protected', passport.authenticate('APIStrategy.STRATEGY_NAME', {session: false }),
      function(request, response){
          console.log("Securty context", request.securityContext)    
          response.send(200, "Success!");
      }
  );

  app.listen(process.env.PORT);
  ```

## Accessing protected resources with the iOS Swift SDK
{: #requesting-swift}

1. Import BMSCore.

  ```swift
  import BMSCore
  ```
  {: codeblock}

2. Invoke a protected resource request.

  ```swift
  BMSClient.sharedInstance.initialize(bluemixRegion: AppID.<region>)
  BMSClient.sharedInstance.authorizationManager = AppIDAuthorizationManager(appid:AppID.sharedInstance)
  var request:Request =  Request(url: "<your protected resource url>")
  request.send(completionHandler: {(response:Response?, error:Error?) in
      //code handling the response here
  })
  ```
  {: codeblock}


## Accessing protected resources with the Android SDK
{: #requesting-android}

1. Invoke a protected resource request.

  ```java
  BMSClient bmsClient = BMSClient.getInstance();
  bmsClient.initialize(getApplicationContext(), AppID.REGION_UK);

  AppIDAuthorizationManager appIdAuthMgr = new AppIDAuthorizationManager(AppID.getInstance())
  bmsClient.setAuthorizationManager(appIdAuthMgr);

  Request request = new Request("<your protected resource url>", Request.GET);
  request.send(this, new ResponseListener() {
  @Override
  public void onSuccess (Response response) {
     //code handling the response here
  }
  @Override
  public void onFailure (Response response, Throwable t, JSONObject extendedInfo) {
      //code handling the failure here
  });
  ```
  {: codeblock}
