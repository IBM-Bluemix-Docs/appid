# Configuring identity providers
{: #setting-up-idp}

Identity providers provide an extra level of authentication for your mobile and web apps. With {{site.data.keyword.appid_full}} you can configure one or several identity providers to set up a single sign-on experience for your app.
{: shortdesc}

You can use the following identity providers:

<dl>
  <dt> Facebook </dt>
    <dd> Users log in to your application by using the same password and email that they use to login into their Facebook account. </dd>
  <dt> Google </dt>
    <dd> Users log in to your application by using the same password and email that they use to login to their Google accounts. </dd>
</dl>


</br>
</br>
</br>

## Default configuration
{: #default}

{{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} provides a default configuration to help with the initial set up of your identity providers.
{: shortdesc}

The default credentials are set up for Facebook and Google. You are limited to 100 uses of the credentials per instance, per day. Because they are {{site.data.keyword.ibm_notm}} credentials, they should be used in your applications only in development mode. Prior to publishing your app, [update the configuration to your own credentials](/docs/services/appid/identity-providers.html).
