# Mobile Client Access is replaced by App ID
{: #mca}

The {{site.data.keyword.amafull}} service is being replaced by {{site.data.keyword.appid_full}}. If you are a current {{site.data.keyword.amashort}} user, you can still use your instances of the service and [access the documentation](/docs/services/mobileaccess/index.html). Any new instances of the service that are created are as part of the {{site.data.keyword.appid_short_notm}} service.
